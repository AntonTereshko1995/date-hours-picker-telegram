# Telegram Date and Time Picker

This repository contains a custom date and time picker for Telegram bots, built using Python and the `python-telegram-bot` library. The picker allows users to select dates and times interactively through Telegram's inline keyboard.

## Features

- **Date Selection**: Users can select a specific date using an intuitive inline keyboard.
- **Time Selection**: After choosing a date, users can pick a time (hours).
- **Customizable**: Easily configure the picker for different use cases, such as scheduling events, booking appointments, or reminders.
- **Efficient UX**: All interactions are handled seamlessly through Telegram's inline buttons, ensuring a smooth user experience.
- **Error Handling**: Built-in validations to ensure the user input is always correct.

## How It Works

1. The bot sends a message with an inline keyboard for selecting a date.
2. Users navigate between months and pick a specific day.
3. Once a date is selected, the bot displays a time picker for hour and minute selection.
4. After the user completes the selection, the bot confirms the chosen date and time.

## Example Usage

The picker can be used for scenarios like:
- Booking appointments
- Scheduling reminders
- Event planning
- House rental systems (e.g., booking a house)
